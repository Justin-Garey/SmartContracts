## Voting On The Blockchain:

The goal of this project is to deploy a smart contract onto the Cardano blockchain that enables people to vote using their Cardano addresses. This can be used for anything from student governance to real elections.

## Expected deliverables:

For Certain:
- A smart contract on the Plutus Platform for Cardano

If Time Allows:
- NFT "I Voted" Stickers
- A Web 3.0 Website to interact with the smart contract

## Meeting Times:

Tues/Thurs 2:00 - 4:00

## Tools to be Used

- The Haskell programming language is being used to create Smart Contracts
- The ghc compiler is installed so VSCode can be used for programming
- ghc stands for glasgow haskell compiler and allows us to compile .hs files
- We are using Git as our version control
- Trello is being used for docmentation of what to do, what has been done, and other information.

## Team Member Roles

The roles of each team member are the same for now. We all need to learn Haskell and practice with the language. Then we will familiarize ourselves with smart contracts and the logic. Lastly we will use the plutus platform to test and implement this.
