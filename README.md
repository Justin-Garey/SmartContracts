## Tools to be Used
This project is being done with the Haskell programming language. 
The ghc compiler is installed so we can use VSCode for programming.
ghc stands for glastow haskell compiler and allows us to compile .hs files.
We are using Git for version control and will use trello for our documentation.
Trello is a project management tool where we can have cards to describe what needs done, 
what has been done, and any other information the team members may need to accomplish 
the task.
