# SmartContracts
The Smart Contracts group repository for CS 3560.
Justin Garey is the Maintainer.
GitHub user: Justin-Garey.

## Tools to be Used
This project is being done with the Haskell programming language. 
The ghc compiler is installed so we can use VSCode for programming.
ghc stands for glastow haskell compiler and allows us to compile .hs files.
We are using Git for version control and will use trello for our documentation.
Trello is a project management tool where we can have cards to describe what needs done, 
what has been done, and any other information the team members may need to accomplish 
the task.

## Team Member Roles
The roles of the team members in this group, Blockchain Smart Contracts, have yet to be determined in a definite sense but we all have responsibilities to fill toward this project before we start dividing the project components amongst ourselves. These responsibilities include becoming familiar with the Haskel programming language. We are most likely going to use the platform Code Wars for this because of the fact that you can directly compare code to a language we are familiar with. We must also learn the basis of smart contract and blockchain programming and architecture. The Plutus platform is great for this as they may provide framework code for these systems.
